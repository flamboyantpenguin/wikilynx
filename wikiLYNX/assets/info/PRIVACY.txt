# wikiLYNX Game Browser | Privacy Policy

## Introduction

wikiLYNX is a game browser application. Since the game of Wikipedia speed-runs is browsing from one article to the other, this application is basically a browser with features and options attached to enhance gameplay. This means that almost all standard rules and practises of browsing applies to using the browser within this app as well.
wikiLYNX makes use of QtWebEngine to implement browsers. QtWebEngine is wrapped around Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF), which means most of the things applicable for Chromium browsers applies here as well.

## Data Collection

As of wikiLYNX 1.5.0, the application *does not collect* any type of data for statistics or for any other purposes. The app interacts with network only to make requests to fetch information (latest version, custom levels etc) and for browsing as mentioned below.

This does not prevent websites you visit via the in-app browsers from collecting some info based on their site practises. These info include

- Your public IP address
- User Agent (Describes the browser, OS and sometimes device type)
- Referrer
- Accepted Content Types
- Cookies (Not stored persistently, Third Part Cookies are blocked)
- Language Preferences
- Screen and Window Information
- Time Zone and System Locale
- JavaScript and Feature Dectection (Fonts, WebGL)
- Hardware Information (Graphics renderer)
- Installed Plugins (PDFium, Widevine , Media Codecs, MIME Handlers)
- WebRTC Metada (Not Applicable)

These info is not collected by wikiLYNX and/or its developers.

As the developer of this app, I have tried my best to implement the best practises to implement good privacy practises. These include disabling third party cookies and implementing Non-Persistent Cookies. Cookies are stored on each session in temporary storage and are cleared once you close the app completely.

All the inbuilt levels within the game are Wikipedia levels. This means that the levels won't force you to navigate to sites outside wikipedia.org. The help documentation is hosted on the GitHub Repository (Wiki section).

As for external levels, it's your responsibility to understand the data collection practises of an external site before adding them to the browser. One must however note that sites have limited access to your system as compared to system browsers.
