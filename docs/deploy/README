# Deployment | Linux

## Introduction

wikiLYNX was initially aimed for Windows devices. As a Linux user myself, I wanted to release wikiLYNX for Linux as well. Initially I went for deploying packages the conventional yet still important ways such as preparing `deb` nd `rpm` binaries. It is relatively easier to deploy packages on `rpm` systems and as of now we support Fedora 40 and above. I found writing `debian` spec files notoriouly hard and it's still imperfect (As always, contributions are welcome). wikiLYNX is also available for Arch Linux via the Arch User Repository. Since I have spent a lot of time on this, I felt the importance of publishing some build info to help everyone build packages on their own and refer for their own projects if required. 

Containers are a great way to deploy packages as it won't distrub the host system. Multi-architecture support (I personally use qemu) makes it even easier to deploy packages for all available platforms. You can find the `Containerfile` I prepared for deployment in this directory. You're free to contribute better alternatives to methods I have used or refer these for your own projects.

## Debian

For Debian systems, the spec files in the source directory of the project is used to prepare the package. The package must be ideally built in an older version of `glibc` to ensure platform-compatability, however Qt6 is not available in Debian 11. For this reason, I'm planning to deploy the package 

## Fedora
