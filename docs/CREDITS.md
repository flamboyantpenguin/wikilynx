# Credits de wikiLYNX Game Browser

This game would not have been what it is now without the support of some wonderful individuals in this world. Their feedback, guidance and support help shaped the project to what is is today.

First I would like to thank [@jonesrison](https://jonesrison.github.io) for the wonderful idea of making this a game. I, [@jonesrison](https://jonesrison.github.io) and @anonymousthendi (don't ask me why he named himself like that) once sat down together in a lab session in our college to play this game. Realising the fun and thrill of the game, we decided to host this game as a college event. The browser was thus born as a solution to implement some rules and a system to decide the winners among the players participating in the event.

The event was hosted at our college, Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology (RSET), Ernakulam, Kerala. The event, though with small hiccups, was a successfull one. The credit of the event goes to some hardworking individuals who volunteered to help us coordinate things. The credit also goes to our department teachers whose guidance and approval accomplished the event.

This project is based on the Qt Project. I believe Qt remains as one of the best GUI frameworks for Core Desktop App Development. The Qt WebEngine is powered by the Chromium Project.

The simple sounds you hear when you start, abort/fail or win a game is made using Chrome Music Lab Song Maker at Chrome Experiments. [Checkout](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker) the fun experiment to make your own sound effects.

I can't deny the power of generative AI technology in this era. I found them helpful to learn some difficult parts of app development, namely Debian, Flatpak and AppImage packaging within a short time.

The forces of the world perhaps aligned in the right timing and in the right direction caused events that led to the development of this game. 

I'm honoured to be part of this serendipitous encounter.
