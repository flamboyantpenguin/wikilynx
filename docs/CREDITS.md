This game wouldn't have been what it is now without the help of some wonder individuals in this world. Their feedback, guidance and support help shaped this what is is now, from the UI to the game system. 

First I would like to thank @jonesrison for the wonderful idea of making this a game. I, @jonesrison and @joel once sat down together in a lab session at college to play this game. Realising the fun and thrill of this game, we decided to host this game as a college event. This browser was thus born as a solution to implement some rules and system to decide winners among the players. 

The event was hosted on Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology. The event though with small hiccups, was a successfull one. The event success should also be credit to somehardworking individuals who volunteered to help us coordinate things. I also thank teachers and all faculty members for their guidance and approval.

This project is based on the Qt Project and I can't fail to admit the potential of this framework. I believe Qt remains as one of the best GUI frameworks in existence. Special thanks to the Chromium Project as well who's behind the QtWebEngine. 

I can't deny the power of generative AI technology in this era. I found them helpful to learn some difficult parts of app development, namely Debian, Flatpak and AppImage packaging within a short time.

The forces of the world perhaps aligned in the right timing and in the right direction caused events that led to the development of this game. I thank this world for the events that led to the development of the game.
